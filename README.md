Predictive Agricultural Modeling Project
Abstract
Agriculture plays a vital role in society, particularly in India where it significantly impacts the economy and food production. Despite its importance, accurately predicting crop yield remains a challenge due to various factors influencing productivity. Traditional methods have struggled to provide satisfactory results, leading to the exploration of deep learning models.

Deep learning-based models have gained attention for their ability to extract meaningful crop features from data to predict yields. However, they face challenges in establishing direct mappings between raw data and yield values. Moreover, their performance depends on the quality of extracted features.

To address these limitations, novel approaches have emerged, including the integration of random forest algorithms for crop and fertilizer recommendations and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for disease prediction and diagnosis. These integrated systems aim to improve accuracy and reduce errors, ultimately enhancing agricultural productivity.

Experimental results demonstrate promising outcomes, showing improved accuracy and reduced error rates. With continued refinement and innovation, these systems have the potential to revolutionize agricultural practices, supporting sustainable food production and economic growth.
